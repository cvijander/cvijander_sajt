    <h1>Inspect selectors</h1>
    <p>CSS selectors are used to select the elements to apply style. Selectors offer a great deal of flexibility and power. Selectors enable you to apply a style to all elements or to one specific element, and even one specific letter.

There are three core types of selectors:

Elements
Classes
IDs
By using these selectors, you can apply styles to many elements or a few.</p>
Element Selectors
An element selector applies to all elements with that tag. Any HTML element can be used as an element selector. Using h1 enables you to modify all h1 elements on the page.

css

Copy
h1 {
    /* style */
}
<h2>Class selectors</h2>
<p>All HTML elements enable you to add a class attribute. class is used to group elements together and enable you to mark them for applying CSS settings.

When creating a resume, you'll likely have sections for your education and employment history. Using a class would allow you to format those elements with the same style.

HTML

Copy
<div class="history">
    <h2>Employer name</h2>
    <h3>Job title</h3>
    <h3>3 Jun 19 - 8 Jun 21</h3>
</div>

<div class="history">
    <h2>School name</h2>
    <h3>Major</h3>
    <h3>Sep 2014 - May 2018</h3>
</div>
In the previous example, you would likely want the formatting for each div to be the same as they're displaying similar types of information. By marking the two div elements with the same class, you can apply the same CSS style to each.

To identify a class in CSS, you prefix a . in front of the name. In our example, you would use .history.

css

Copy
.history {
    /* your styles */
}
If using a CSS file, you would write the class style definition in the CSS file. The class attribute in HTML references the definition from the CSS file.</p>

<h2>Pseudo-classes</h2>
<p>Pseudo-classes enable you to identify elements based on their location on a page or how the user is interacting with them.

As a user interacts with a web page, the state of various elements will change. A user could be hovering their mouse over an item, and you want the color to change when they hover. Or the user may have clicked a link. After they've visited that link, you may want to let them know by changing the style. CSS supports many pseudo-classes, which are applied dynamically based on what the user does or has done. Pseudo-classes are prefixed by a :, and are placed after another selector.

For example, to set the background color of a link to yellow when a user hovers their cursor over it, you could use the following CSS:

css

Copy
a:hover {
    background-color: yellow;
}
Some of the most common pseudo-classes are listed in the following table:

Pseudo-class	Description
hover	User is hovering their cursor over an item
visited	A link that has been previously clicked
link	An unvisited link
first-child	The first child matching the selector in a hierarchy
last-child	The last child matching the selector in a hierarchy
 Important

Using pseudo-elements and CSS, you can remove the underline from hyperlinks. As a general rule, it's best to leave the underline for accessibility purposes. The underlined text allows a user to quickly identify links on a page.</p>

<h2>ID selectors</h2>
<p>
    ID Selectors
Similar to classes, an ID allows you to apply a style to an element. But, while a class can be applied to multiple elements, an ID must be unique and refer to only one element.

On a resume, you might have a section for social media, such as Twitter, GitHub, or your blog. If you wanted a custom style for that section, you could set an ID:

HTML

Copy
<div id="social-media">
    <!-- list of links -->
</div>
IDs are prefixed with a # in CSS:

css

Copy
#social-media {
    /* style */
}
 Note

Standard naming convention for classes and IDs is to use "skewer-casing." Each word is lowercase, and separated with a -. The name skewer-case comes from how the words appear as if they could be on a skewer.
