    <p>CSS Structure
If you want your HTML page to display all text between the h1 tags with the color orange, you could use the CSS code that follows.

css

<code>
h1 {
    color: orange;
}
</code>
The CSS code above starts with (h1) that selects the HTML you want to style. The h1 in the sample is called a selector.

Notice the code inside the curly braces, color: orange;t declares how the selected h1 tag should be styled. The CSS code in the curly braces { }, such as color: orange; is called a declaration.

Your sample declaration contains a property, color, which is separated from a value, orange, with a colon (:), and the end of the setting is marked by a semicolon (;).</p>
