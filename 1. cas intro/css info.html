    <h1>Css info</h1>
    <p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to apply formatting or style to a webpage's content. With CSS, you can tell the browser which fonts and colors to use and tell it many other ways to display your content. Using CSS, you tell the browser which elements to select and then describe the styles to apply to those elements.

Imagine you're creating a webpage for your resume. You created the page using HTML, and want to set various style options such as the color and fonts. You'll modify the style by using CSS.</p>
