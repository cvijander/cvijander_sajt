    <h1>Komentari</h1>
    <p>As with any computer language, CSS supports comments. To comment in a section of CSS, you would use /* comment */. The /* identifies the start of the comment, and */ marks the end. A CSS comment can cover multiple lines of text. Comments are a great way to leave notes for yourself or other developers or to take notes while learning the language.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Important

CSS comments are public, and accessible by both the browser and users of your website. Do not store sensitive information in comments.

CSS comments are formatted differently from HTML comments. Comments in HTML use the <!--comment--> syntax.</p>
