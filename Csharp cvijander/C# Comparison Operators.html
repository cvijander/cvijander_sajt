    Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either True or False. These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
Console.WriteLine(x > y); // returns True because 5 is greater than 3

A list of all comparison operators:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	Equal to	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
