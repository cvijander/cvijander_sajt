    Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)
There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

SyntaxGet your own C# Server
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;
Instead of writing:

Example
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Good day.");
} 
else 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Good evening.");
}

You can simply write:

Example
int time = 20;
string result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
Console.WriteLine(result);
