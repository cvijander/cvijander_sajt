    Strings - Special Characters
Because strings must be written within quotes, C# will misunderstand this string, and generate an error:

string txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Escape character	Result	Description
\'	'	Single quote
\"	"	Double quote
\\	\	Backslash
The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
string txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

The sequence \'  inserts a single quote in a string:

Example
string txt = "It\'s alright.";

The sequence \\  inserts a single backslash in a string:

Example
string txt = "The character \\ is called backslash.";

Other useful escape characters in C# are:

Code	Result	Try it
\n	New Line	
\t	Tab	
\b	Backspace
