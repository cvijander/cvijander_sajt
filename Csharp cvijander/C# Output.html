    C# Output
To output values or print text in C#, you can use the WriteLine() method:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

You can add as many WriteLine() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:

Example
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");

You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:

Example
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);

The Write Method
There is also a Write() method, which is similar to WriteLine().

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

Example
Console.Write("Hello World! ");
Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");

Note that we add an extra space when needed (after "Hello World!" in the example above), for better readability.
