    C# Comments
Comments can be used to explain C# code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by C# (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
// This is a comment
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:

Example
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");  // This is a comment

C# Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by C#.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

Example
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 

Single or multi-line comments?
It is up to you which you want to use. Normally, we use // for short comments, and /* */ for longer.
