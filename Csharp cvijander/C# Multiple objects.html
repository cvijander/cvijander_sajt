    Multiple Objects
You can create multiple objects of one class:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
Create two objects of Car:

class Car
{
  string color = "red";
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj1 = new Car();
    Car myObj2 = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj1.color);
    Console.WriteLine(myObj2.color);
  }
} 
 

Using Multiple Classes
You can also create an object of a class and access it in another class. This is often used for better organization of classes (one class has all the fields and methods, while the other class holds the Main() method (code to be executed)).

prog2.cs
prog.cs
prog2.cs
class Car 
{
  public string color = "red";
}
prog.cs
class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.color);
  }
}

Did you notice the public keyword? It is called an access modifier, which specifies that the color variable/field of Car is accessible for other classes as well, such as Program.

You will learn much more about access modifiers and classes/objects in the next chapters.
