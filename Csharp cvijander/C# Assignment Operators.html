    Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
int x = 10;

The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Example
int x = 10;
x += 5;

A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
